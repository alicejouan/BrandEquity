# Brand-Equity-Analysis: Moonshot Clinical Systems

This is a school project I did in the Customer Insights And Analysis class at USC. It's a mock case created by Professor Larry Vincent. The goal of the project is to help a start-up healthcare company, Moonshot, develop a data-driven branding strategy to gain market share from competitors.

In this case, I will conduct brand equity and cluster analysis with R and visualize data with Tableau....
